Google Homepage Project

The task is to make a copy of Google's homepage.

Tips to remember:
1. Don't be a perfectionist - it just has to look like Google.
2. Use Google.
3. Use the live server extension.
4. Look into webkit-appearance and moz-appearance if things aren't working.

Start with main elements, then navbar, then footer.

Do as much as possible on your own first.
